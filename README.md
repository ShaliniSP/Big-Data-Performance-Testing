The main task was to analyse any three Linux application using perf
based on factors such as number of instructions executed, number of
cache references, number of cache misses and number of branch
miss-predictions.

To run the files:

Run the python mapper code on the text files generated by perf
>python mapper.py < scilab_report_1.txt > scilab_1.txt

Run the code on all the files then upload them to the HDFS
>hadoop fs -put /home/hduser/scilab_1.txt /Input/

Run the jar file
>cd /usr/local/hadoop
>bin/hadoop jar /home/hduser/Desktop/WordCountF/WordCountJ.jar WordCount /Input Output
